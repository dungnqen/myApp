<p>Flat Socket Cap Screws are mainly used in applications which require a visually pleasing fastener with minimal load bearing capabilities. So, please note that these screws are not intended to be used in high strength applications. Sockets whose wear resistance is to be protected in the long run can use these screws instead of high strength countersunk screws. It is available in stainless steel, carbon steel, and alloy steel to bear more wear and tear while also making it more corrosion resistant.

    The procedure to tighten these in place on the surface is to apply the recommended level of torque on the nut while inserting and holding the key into the socket. If there is no sufficient space on the surface for wrenches to create an opening for screws, then the head of these countersunk socket screws is in the neat sitting of the screws on the surface and in the smooth construction of structures.</p>
